Revenue forecasting in the hotel industry is challenging due to fluctuating demand, seasonal trends, 
and evolving customer behavior. Traditional methods fail to capture complex factors like booking 
trends, demographics, and economic conditions, leading to poor pricing strategies and financial losses. 
This project uses machine learning algorithm to 
improve prediction accuracy by analyzing historical booking data. An interactive Power BI dashboard 
provides real-time insights for better decision-making. By combining AI and business intelligence, this 
system ensures optimized pricing, improved resource allocation, and increased profitability.
